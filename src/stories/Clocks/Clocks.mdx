# Clocks

Unopinionated utility that simplifies process of building `clocks` components.

<Canvas of={ClocksStorybooks.Base} />

## base implementation

Base implementation of clocks using this package looks like this:

```jsx

// import & create Clocks component
    import { Clocks } from 'spc-calendar'

    <Clocks

    // pass params (date & callback to change date)

          date={new Date()}
          onChange={(date: Date) => {
            `updateArgs({ date })`;
          }}
        >

        {/* destructurize object that passed through render prop list & pick list of time-fragments that we want to pick */}

          {
            ({ hourList, minuteList, secondList }) => (

            {/* utilize prop list with time data to render fragments*/}

            <div className="flex gap-2">
              <div className={BlocksStyles}>

                 {/*render hourList & utilize prop list with time data to render pickers by spreading it over conventional HTML-button*/}

                {hourList.map(({ number, select, isSelected }) => (
                  <button
                    onClick={() => select()}
                    className={ButtonStyles(isSelected)}
                  >
                    {number}
                  </button>
                ))}
              </div>

              {/* repeat it for every time-fragment if necessary */}

              <div className={BlocksStyles}>
                {minuteList.map(({ number, select, isSelected }) => (
                  <button
                    onClick={() => select()}
                    className={ButtonStyles(isSelected)}
                  >
                    {number}
                  </button>
                ))}
              </div>
              <div className={BlocksStyles}>
                {secondList.map(({ number, select, isSelected }) => (
                  <button
                    onClick={() => select()}
                    className={ButtonStyles(isSelected)}
                  >
                    {number}
                  </button>
                ))}
              </div>
            </div>
            )
          }
        </Clocks>
```

## components

In this package `clocks` consists of 2 main fragments:

- hook `useClocks` that generates necessary data to implement clocks with picker functionality.
- component `Clocks` that behaves as a minimal representation of `useClocks` functionality. It returns date-params through render-prop, so developers have full control over styling & behavior of component in general.

## apis

**propList to accept**:
| PROP | DESC |
| ---- | ---- |
| date |actual JS-Date object or string with correct date that is possible to parse via `new Date` method |
| onChange | callback that will fire when `selectDate` method is called & return selected date |
| locale | https://shorturl.at/pyEW3 |
| timezone | https://www.iana.org/time-zones |

**propList to return**:
| PROP | DESC |
| ---- | ---- |
| date | actual JS-Date object or string with correct date that is possible to parse via `new Date` method |
| hourList | an array of elements of time-fragment signature |
| minuteList | an array of elements of time-fragment signature |
| secondList | an array of elements of time-fragment signature |

**propList of `time-fragment` signatures**
| PROP | DESC |
| ---- | ---- |
| number | number that represents certain time-fragment (hour, minute or second) |
| isSelected | boolean that shows if a time-fragment from array is a selected time-fragment |
| selectTime | callback that triggers `onChange` function passed to `Clocks` as a prop & return a date with time changed to selected |
| timeSelectPropList | propList to spread over a button element that will be used as an element that should trigger `onChange`

## examples

Base implementation of calendar using this package looks like this:

```jsx
    <Clocks
          date={new Date()}
          onChange={(date: Date) => {
            `updateArgs({ date })`;
          }}
        >
          {({ hourList, minuteList, secondList }) => (
            <div className="flex gap-2">
              <div className={BlocksStyles}>
                {hourList.map(({ number, select, isSelected }) => (
                  <button
                    onClick={() => select()}
                    className={ButtonStyles(isSelected)}
                  >
                    {number}
                  </button>
                ))}
              </div>
              <div className={BlocksStyles}>
                {minuteList.map(({ number, select, isSelected }) => (
                  <button

                  </button>
                ))}
              </div>
              <div className={BlocksStyles}>

                  <button
                    onClick={() => select()}

          )}
