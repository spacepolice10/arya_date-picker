# Dateform

Unopinionated utility that simplifies process of building `dateform` components.

<Canvas of={DateformStorybooks.Base} />

## anatomy

In this package `clocks` consists of 2 main fragments:

- hook `useClocks` that generates necessary data to implement clocks with picker functionality.
- component `Clocks` that behaves as a minimal representation of `useClocks` functionality. It returns date-params through render-prop, so developers have full control over styling & behavior of component in general.

## api

**propList to accept**:
| PROP | DESC |
| ---- | ---- |
| date |actual JS-Date object or string with correct date that is possible to parse via `new Date` method |
| onChange | callback that will fire when `selectDate` method is called & return selected date |
| locale | https://shorturl.at/pyEW3 |
| timezone | https://www.iana.org/time-zones |

**propList to return**:
| PROP | DESC |
| ---- | ---- |
| date | actual JS-Date object or string with correct date that is possible to parse via `new Date` method |
| hourList | an array of elements of time-fragment signature |
| minuteList | an array of elements of time-fragment signature |
| secondList | an array of elements of time-fragment signature |

**propList of `time-fragment` signatures**
| PROP | DESC |
| ---- | ---- |
| number | number that represents certain time-fragment (hour, minute or second) |
| isSelected | boolean that shows if a time-fragment from array is a selected time-fragment |
| selectTime | callback that triggers `onChange` function passed to `Clocks` as a prop & return a date with time changed to selected |
| timeSelectPropList | propList to spread over a button element that will be used as an element that should trigger `onChange`

## examples

Base implementation of calendar using this package looks like this:

```jsx
      <Dateform
          {...args}
          onChange={(date: Date) => {
            `updateArgs({ date })`;
          }}
        >
          {({ yearFormPropList, monthsFormPropList, daysFormPropList }) => (
            <div>
              <input {...yearFormPropList} className={dateFormStyles} />
              {"/"}
              <input {...monthsFormPropList} className={dateFormStyles} />
              {"/"}
              <input {...daysFormPropList} className={dateFormStyles} />
            </div>
          )}
        </Dateform>
```
