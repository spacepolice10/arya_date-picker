# RangerClocks

Unopinionated utility that simplifies process of building `ranger clocks` components.

<Canvas of={RangerClocksStorybooks.Base} />

## anatomy

In this package `ranger clocks` consists of 2 main fragments:

- hook `useRangerClocks` that generates necessary data to generate clocks with picking ranges functionality.
- component `RangerClocks`s that behaves as a minimal representation of `useRangerClocks` functionality. It returns date-params through render-prop, so developers have full control over styling & behavior of component in general.

## api

**propList to accept**:
| PROP | DESC |
| ---- | ---- |
| date |actual JS-Date object or string with correct date that is possible to parse via `new Date` method |
| onChange | callback that will fire when `selectDate` method is called & return selected date |
| startsFromDate:? | date that will be used as a starting point to draw calendar from. If chosen July of 2002, even though `date` is May of 2020, `useCalendar` will return days of July 2002 |
| monthsNumberToDraw:? | amount of months to return from hook. It might be useful when showing a lof of months is necessary (e.g. for building full-fledged calendars) |
| locale | https://shorturl.at/pyEW3 |
| timezone | https://www.iana.org/time-zones |

**propList to return**:
| PROP | DESC |
| ---- | ---- |
| date | actual JS-Date object or string with correct date that is possible to parse via `new Date` method |
| months | an array of objects with days signature ( _please refer to `days APIS` within tables below_ )
| selectPrev | callback that switches `startsFromDate` prop to previous month |
| selectNext | callback that switches `startsFromDate` prop to next month |

**propList of `days` signatures**
| PROP | DESC |
| ---- | ---- |
| daysNumber | number of days from the first one in the month to the last one based on what number JS Date object returns |
| daysName | name of day at specific day number |
| isActive | boolean that shows if a day from array is a current day |
| isSelected | boolean that shows if a day from array is a selected day |
| selectDate | callback that triggers `onChange` function passed to `Calendar` as a prop |
| dateSelectPropList | propList to spread over a button element that will be used as an element that should trigger `onChange`

## examples

Base implementation of calendar using this package looks like this:

```jsx
   <RangerCalendar
          {...args}
          date={args.date as Date}
          onChange={(date: Date) => {
            `updateArgs({
              date,
            })`;
          }}
        >
          {({ months }) => (
            <>
              {months.map(({ days }) => (
                <div className="grid grid-cols-7 w-52 p-2">
                  {days.map(
                    ({
                      daysNumber,
                      isInRanges,
                      dateSelectPropList,
                      isSelected,
                    }) => (
                      <button
                        {...dateSelectPropList}
                        key={dateSelectPropList?.key}
                        style={{
                          borderColor: isSelected ? "hotpink" : "",
                          backgroundColor: isInRanges ? "black" : "",
                          color: isInRanges ? "white" : "",
                        }}
                        className="flex items-center p-[2px] border-b border-transparent justify-center"
                      >
                        {daysNumber}
                      </button>
                    )
                  )}
                </div>
              ))}
            </>
          )}
        </RangerCalendar>
```
