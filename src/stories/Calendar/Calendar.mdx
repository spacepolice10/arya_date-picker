# Calendar

Unopinionated utility that simplifies process of building `calendar` components.

<Canvas of={CalendarStorybooks.Base} />

## base implementation

Base implementation of calendar using this package looks like this:

```jsx

// import & create Calendar component
import { Calendar } from 'spc-calendar'

<Calendar

 // pass params (date & callback to change date)

    date={new Date()}
    onChange={(date: Date) => `changeDate(date)`}
  >

  {/* destructurize object that passed through render prop list to pick `months` object which contains a list of days with necessary data to render & pick them */}

  {({ months }) => (
    <div>

      {/* render `months` data as an array */}

      {months.map(({ daysNumber, isActive, isSelected, dateSelectPropList }) => (
        <>

          {/*  months array includes offset & list of days to render in calendar & prop list to convert conventional HTML-button into date selector. Spread dateSelectPropList over button & style it using other params passed through */}

          <button
            {...dateSelectPropList}
            style={{
              borderColor: isSelected ? "hotpink" : "",
              backgroundColor: isActive ? "black" : "",
              color: isActive ? "white" : "",
            }}
            className="flex items-center border-b border-transparent justify-center"
          >
            {daysNumber}
          </button>
        </>
      ))}
    </div>
  )}
</Calendar>
```

## components

In this package `calendar` consists of 2 main fragments:

- hook `useCalendar` that generates necessary data to generate calendar with picker functionality.
- component `Calendar` that behaves as a minimal representation of `useCalendar` functionality. It returns date-params through render-prop, so developers have full control over styling & behavior of component in general.

## import

- use `import { Calendar } from 'spc-calendar'` if you wish to work with a component
- use `import { useCalendar } from 'spc-calendar'` if you wish to build a component yourself

## apis

**options**:
| PROP | DESC |
| ---- | ---- |
| date |actual JS-Date object or string with correct date that is possible to parse via `new Date` method |
| onChange | callback that will fire when `selectDate` method is called & return selected date |
| startsFromDate:? | date that will be used as a starting point to draw calendar from. If chosen July of 2002, even though `date` is May of 2020, `useCalendar` will return days of July 2002 |
| monthsNumberToDraw:? | amount of months to return from hook. It might be useful when showing a lof of months is necessary (e.g. for building full-fledged calendars) |
| locale | https://shorturl.at/pyEW3 |
| timezone | https://www.iana.org/time-zones |

**returned propList**:
| PROP | DESC |
| ---- | ---- |
| date | actual JS-Date object or string with correct date that is possible to parse via `new Date` method |
| months | an array of objects with days signature ( _please refer to `days APIS` within tables below_ )
| selectPrev | callback that switches `startsFromDate` prop to previous month |
| selectNext | callback that switches `startsFromDate` prop to next month |

**`months` signatures**
| PROP | DESC |
| ---- | ---- |
| monthsName | name of month of the current selected date based on passed `locale` |
| days | list of days to render & work with ( _please refer to `days` signature_ ) |
| yearNumber | number of a year of rendered month object |
| monthsNumber | number of rendered months object |

**`days` signatures**
| PROP | DESC |
| ---- | ---- |
| daysNumber | number of days from the first one in the month to the last one based on what number JS Date object returns |
| daysName | name of day at specific day number |
| isActive | boolean that shows if a day from array is a current day |
| isSelected | boolean that shows if a day from array is a selected day |
| selectDate | callback that triggers `onChange` function passed to `Calendar` as a prop |
| dateSelectPropList | propList to spread over a button element that will be used as an element that should trigger `onChange`

## examples

Base implementation of calendar using this package looks like this:

```jsx
<Calendar date={new Date()} onChange={(date: Date) => `changeDate(date)`}>
  // we pass callback in the body of component
  {
    ({ months }) => (
    <div>
      // render `months` data as an array
      {months.map(({ daysNumber, isActive, isSelected, dateSelectPropList }) => (
        <>
          // months array includes offset & list of days to render in calendar
          <button
            {...dateSelectPropList}
            style={{
              borderColor: isSelected ? "hotpink" : "",
              backgroundColor: isActive ? "black" : "",
              color: isActive ? "white" : "",
            }}
            className="flex items-center border-b border-transparent justify-center"
          >
            {daysNumber}
          </button>
        </>
      ))}
    </div>
    )
  }
</Calendar>
```
